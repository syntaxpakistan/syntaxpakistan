      <Section n="1" title="Who is responsible for your data">
        <p>
          For your account, profile, billing and platform usage data, Syntax of Life (Pvt) Ltd is the{" "}
          <strong className="text-ink">data controller</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For project content exchanged on the marketplace — RFQ details, sample metadata, reports and deliverables —
          the <strong className="text-ink">Customer is the controller</strong> and Syntax, together with the engaged
          Provider, acts as a <strong className="text-ink">processor</strong> handling that data on documented
          instructions. Where we process personal data as a processor, a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) is available
          on request and forms part of the contract.

      <Section n="2" title="Data we collect">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Account & identity</strong> — name, organisation, role, email, phone, credentials (hashed), TOTP second-factor enrolment.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Profile & verification</strong> — capabilities, instruments, accreditations, addresses, submitted verification documents.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Marketplace activity</strong> — RFQs, quotes, awards, project stages, QC verdicts, milestone invoices, payment records, reviews and in-platform messages.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Uploaded files</strong> — documents, reports and receipts you attach to projects (≤25&nbsp;MB each).</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Technical & usage</strong> — log data, IP address, device and browser type, feature usage, security and audit events.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Communications</strong> — support requests, consultations and correspondence.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section n="3" title="Genetic, health and special-category data">
        <p>
          Genetic and health data are <strong className="text-ink">special category data</strong> under GDPR Article 9
          and equivalent provisions elsewhere — they receive heightened protection. The Gateway is designed so that
          this data mostly never reaches us:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li><strong className="text-ink">No raw genomic hosting.</strong> FASTQ, BAM, CRAM and comparable raw sequence files are never stored on our systems; they move directly between Customer and Provider.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">De-identification required.</strong> Project attachments must not contain direct identifiers of research participants or patients. Customers must de-identify or pseudonymise personal data in uploaded documents — for HIPAA-covered customers, consistent with 45&nbsp;C.F.R. §164.514.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">No re-identification.</strong> Any attempt to re-identify de-identified or pseudonymised data, or to match it against external datasets, is a material breach of our Terms.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Processor position.</strong> Where special-category data legitimately appears in project content, the Customer warrants it has a lawful basis — consent, ethical approval or another Article&nbsp;9 condition — and we process it only on documented instructions under heightened access controls.</li>

      <Section n="5" title="Who we share data with">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Marketplace counterparties</strong> — Providers see RFQ content; Customers see awarded quote details; identity is unmasked only as the project requires (see Terms §5).</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Service vendors</strong> — cloud hosting, payment processing and transactional email under contract and appropriate safeguards.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Professional advisers & authorities</strong> — auditors, counsel, and regulators or courts where required by law.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Corporate events</strong> — a merger or acquisition counterparty under equivalent confidentiality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not sell personal data. We do not share quote contents between competing providers. We do not use
          project content to train public AI models.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="6" title="International transfers">
        <p>
          Our infrastructure may process data in data centres outside Pakistan. Where personal data subject to GDPR or
          UK GDPR is transferred internationally, we rely on recognised transfer mechanisms — adequacy decisions or
          Standard Contractual Clauses — and contractual equivalents for other jurisdictions. Transfers of project
          content between parties happen under their own agreements.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="7" title="Retention">
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Accounts</strong> — kept while active; deleted or anonymised within 12 months of closure unless a longer period is legally required.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Financial & transaction records</strong> — retained per applicable tax and company law (typically up to 7 years).</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Project records & files</strong> — retained for the project lifetime and the contract&apos;s stated period; deleted on valid request subject to legal holds.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Security & audit logs</strong> — 12–24 months for security investigations and compliance.</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Backups</strong> — deleted content may persist in encrypted backups for a limited rotation period before being purged.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section n="8" title="Security">
        <p>
          We apply layered technical and organisational controls aligned with ISO/IEC 27001 principles: encryption in
          transit and at rest, role-isolated access (customers, providers, suppliers and operations each see only
          their scope), least-privilege staff access, mandatory two-factor authentication for privileged operations,
          database-level separation of sealed quotes, and an audit log across privileged actions. No system is
          perfectly secure; we maintain incident-response procedures and will notify affected parties and regulators
          of reportable breaches within required timelines.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="9" title="Your rights">
        <p>Where GDPR, UK GDPR or equivalent law applies, you may exercise:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-1.5 pl-5">
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Access</strong> — confirmation and a copy of your personal data;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Rectification</strong> — correction of inaccurate data;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Erasure</strong> — deletion subject to legal retention duties;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Portability</strong> — a structured, machine-readable export;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Restriction & objection</strong> — limit or object to processing, including marketing;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Withdraw consent</strong> — where processing rests on consent;</li>
          <li><strong className="text-ink">Complain</strong> — to your supervisory authority.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Send requests via <Link href="/company/contact" className="text-blue hover:underline">contact</Link>. We
          respond within one month (GDPR) or the locally applicable period. For project content where a Customer or
          institution is the controller, we will refer you to that party as required.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="10" title="Cookies and tracking">
        <p>
          We use strictly-necessary cookies for session integrity, security and preferences. Optional analytics
          cookies, where used, are non-identifying and can be disabled without affecting core functionality. We do
          not run third-party advertising trackers.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="11" title="Children">
        <p>
          The Gateway is a professional B2B service, not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal
          data of minors; where research participant data concerns minors it is governed by the submitting
          organisation&apos;s ethics approvals and consent framework.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section n="12" title="Automated decisions">
        <p>
          We do not make solely automated decisions with legal or similarly significant effect. RFQ routing matches
          declared capabilities — a form of sorting, not a decision about you.
